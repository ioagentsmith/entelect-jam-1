Welcome to the 1st Entelect Game Jam! We hope you'll have a lot of fun making a fun little game today.

# Theme & Rules

The theme is simple: make a fun space shooter in any one of the many SHMUP sub-genres using the provided art (and optionally this example project as starting point). If you need some inspiration I wrote a little blog post about [SHMUP mechanics](https://chaotik.co.za/shootem-up-mechanics) - it's a bit rough as I didn't have enough time, but perhaps it will help.

In terms of rules:
 * You have 8 hours (+1 for submission). Start at 08:00 finish at 17:00.
 * During submission hour submit Windows binaries to: https://itch.io/jam/entelect-jam-1
 * __Must__ use at least some of the supplied art: [Kenney Space Shooter Redux](http://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux)
 * __May__ use any free / open-source art or sound resources.
 * Teams or individual submissions welcome.

After submission we'll play each other's games and vote on 3 categories:
 * Fun: Is the game fun?
 * Graphics: Is the game pretty and juicy?
 * Coolness: Does the game perhaps fall flat in other areas but tried to do something cool?

The prizes are bobble heads:
 * Overall winner: Boba Fett
 * Coolness: BB8
 * Fun: R2D2
 * Grapihcs: Alien
